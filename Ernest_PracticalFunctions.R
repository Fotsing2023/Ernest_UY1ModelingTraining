# in the above piece of code, we created two simple functions first: for calculating the radius of a circle given its diameter and for calculating the circumference of a circle given its radius. Since originally we knew only the diameter of a circle (equal to 4), we called the radius_from_diameter function inside the circumference function to calculate first the radius from the provided value of diameter and then calculate the circumference of the circle. While this approach can be useful in many cases, we should be careful with it and avoid passing too many functions as arguments to other functions since it can affect the code readability.
