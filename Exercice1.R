#Assignment #1: Basic Linear Regression: Elevation and Temperature in the USA
ExerciseA Instructions
In a new and appropriately-named
script file, follow the linear regression
workflow demonstrated to analyze the
climate data, this time for only stations in the United States. The ultimate objective is to determine how
well elevation predicts annual temperature in this region, and to use the regression model to predict
annual temperature for Front Royal, VA
Proceed through the entire analysis workflow and answer the following questions. This assignment is
worth 5 points. The readability and organization of your code will count for 0.5 points of this total

Study Questions
1. What is the regression (beta) coefficient for elevation? (0.5 pts)
2. What is the predicted change in annual temperature, with a 100 m increase in elevation? (1 pt)
3. How much variation in temperature is explained by elevation in the US? (1 pt)
4. Using ggplot, generate a scatterplot of temperature vs. elevation data. Include your fitted regression
line and give appropriate labels for both axes. (1 pt)
5. Use your regression equation to predict the annual average temperature for Front Royal, VA, which is
at an elevation of 170m. (1 pt)
